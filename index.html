 <h2>We can not only link pages which are on internet but also which are on our computer</h2>
 <p>we can link them by pasting their url from their properties in "a" tag instead of writing https.</p>
 <p>Writing url is very long process we can short it by copying the html documents into the folder where your current html is which you are editing</p>
 <p> now you can simply write their names instead of their long url's</p>
